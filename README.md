# Kotlin GUI Starter

This is a starter project for a simple Kotlin GUI application.

The Java Swing library is used, plus the FlatLAF look-and-feel for a reasonably modern look.

The app is structured to provide a simple view / model setup with the App class storing application data (the 'model'), and the MainWindow class providing the 'view'.
